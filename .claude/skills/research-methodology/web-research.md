# Web Research Guidelines

How to conduct effective web searches for domain knowledge and best practices.

## Search Strategy

### Query Formulation

For domain coverage research, use these patterns in order:

1. **Comprehensive checklist** (primary)
   - "[domain] comprehensive checklist [current year]"
   - "[domain] complete guide [current year]"

2. **Best practices** (secondary)
   - "[domain] best practices guide"
   - "[domain] professional standards"

3. **Audit/review focused** (tertiary)
   - "[domain] audit checklist professional"
   - "[domain] review criteria"

4. **What to include** (fallback)
   - "[domain] what to include"
   - "[domain] essential elements"

### Examples by Domain

| Domain | Primary Query | Fallback Query |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| SEO | "SEO comprehensive checklist 2026" | "SEO best practices guide" |
| Content Writing | "content writing checklist 2026" | "content writing professional standards" |
| API Design | "API design best practices 2026" | "REST API audit checklist" |
| Security | "security audit checklist OWASP 2026" | "application security standards" |
| UX | "UX design checklist 2026" | "user experience audit criteria" |
| Testing | "software testing checklist 2026" | "QA best practices guide" |

## Search Limits

- **Max 3-5 searches** per domain
- **Stop early** when finding consistent patterns across 3+ sources
- **Expand search** only if initial results are sparse or contradictory

## Result Prioritization

Prefer sources in this order:

### Tier 1: Official & Standards (Weight: High)
- Official documentation (MDN, W3C, OWASP)
- Standards bodies (ISO, IEEE)
- Platform-official guides (Google, Microsoft, AWS)

### Tier 2: Industry Leaders (Weight: High)
- Recognized experts with credentials
- Major tech company engineering blogs
- Established industry publications

### Tier 3: Professional Publications (Weight: Medium)
- Smashing Magazine, CSS-Tricks, A List Apart
- InfoQ, ThoughtWorks, Martin Fowler
- Domain-specific professional journals

### Tier 4: Community Resources (Weight: Low)
- High-quality blogs with author credentials
- Awesome-* lists with active maintenance
- Stack Overflow canonical answers

## Handling Edge Cases

### Unknown/Niche Domains

If domain has few search results:

1. **Broaden search**
   - "[domain] guide" (without year)
   - "what is [domain]"
   - "[domain] introduction"

2. **Look for related domains**
   - Find parent or adjacent domains
   - Search for "[related domain] + [niche aspect]"

3. **Fall back to general quality indicators**
   - Use generic agent quality checklist
   - Evaluate: purpose clarity, step completeness, output quality

4. **Mark appropriately**
   - "Limited research available for [domain]"
   - Don't penalize for research limitations

### Conflicting Information

When sources disagree:

1. **Note the conflict** explicitly
2. **Prefer more recent sources** (last 12 months)
3. **Prefer more authoritative sources** (Tier 1 > Tier 2)
4. **Present both perspectives** if disagreement is significant
5. **Weight toward consensus** when 2+ sources agree

### Outdated Domains

For rapidly evolving domains (AI, JS frameworks, cloud services):
- Strongly prefer current year sources
- Flag anything older than 2 years
- Note "standards are evolving" when appropriate

For stable domains (SQL basics, design principles, algorithms):
- Older sources (3-5 years) are acceptable
- Focus on timeless principles over tool-specific advice

## Search Execution Checklist

Before searching:
- [ ] Domain clearly identified
- [ ] Primary query formulated
- [ ] Fallback queries prepared

During searching:
- [ ] Track sources consulted
- [ ] Note source quality tier
- [ ] Record key findings per source
- [ ] Stop when patterns converge

After searching:
- [ ] 3+ sources consulted
- [ ] At least 1 Tier 1-2 source found
- [ ] Consistent patterns identified
- [ ] Conflicts noted if present
