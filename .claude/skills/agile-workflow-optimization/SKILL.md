## Description
Provides agile methodology patterns for workflow optimization, backlog management, and continuous improvement. Covers value stream mapping, WIP limits, Kanban/Scrum principles, and productivity metrics.

## Core Principles

### 1. Continuous Improvement (Kaizen)
Every iteration is an opportunity to improve. Small, incremental changes compound over time. Never accept "good enough" as permanent - always identify the next improvement.

### 2. Limit Work in Progress (WIP)
Finishing work is more valuable than starting work. High WIP leads to context switching, delays, and quality degradation. Set explicit WIP limits and respect them.

### 3. Optimize for Flow, Not Utilization
100% utilization creates bottlenecks. Slack time enables responsiveness and continuous improvement. Optimize for throughput (completed work) not busyness (started work).

### 4. Empirical Process Control
Make decisions based on observed data, not assumptions. Measure cycle time, lead time, and throughput. Inspect and adapt based on real metrics.

Use when:
- Evaluating workflow efficiency
- Designing backlog structure
- Identifying process bottlenecks
- Implementing continuous improvement

## When to Use This Skill
- **Workflow evaluation**: Is the epic → task → set-up → develop flow optimal?
- **Backlog management**: How should tasks be organized and prioritized?
- **WIP limits**: Should we limit in-progress work?
- **Process improvement**: What changes would increase velocity?
- **Framework selection**: Scrum vs Kanban vs hybrid?

## Supporting Files
- value-stream-mapping.md - Visualize workflow and identify bottlenecks
- wip-limits.md - Work-in-progress constraints and flow optimization
- continuous-improvement.md - Kaizen patterns and experimentation
- scrum-patterns.md - Scrum ceremonies, story points, velocity, and sprint planning

## Workflows
- workflows/retrospective.md - Guided retrospective facilitation with 5+ formats

## Constraints

- Never apply agile ceremonies without understanding their purpose (cargo culting)
- Don't impose WIP limits without measuring current flow first
- Avoid process changes during critical delivery periods
- Don't optimize local efficiency at the expense of global flow
- Never skip retrospectives - they are the engine of improvement
