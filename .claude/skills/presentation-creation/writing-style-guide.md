# Writing Style Guide

McKinsey-style tone patterns for professional presentations. These guidelines help you write clear, compelling content that communicates effectively.

**Goal**: Write content that is confident, specific, and actionable. Good writing supports your message - it doesn't draw attention to itself.

**When to use this guide**:
- You want to elevate generic content to professional quality
- Your text feels wordy, hedging, or vague
- You're writing for senior stakeholders or executives

## Activation

Apply when writing:
- Slide text and action titles
- Bullet points and takeaways
- Executive summaries
- Speaker notes
- Recommendation sections

## Tone Principles

### 1. Direct and Confident
State conclusions without hedging. Replace qualifiers with assertions.

- **Avoid**: "We think this might work"
- **Use**: "This approach delivers results"

### 2. Evidence-Based
Support claims with specific data. Quantify whenever possible.

- **Avoid**: "Sales improved significantly"
- **Use**: "Sales increased 23% quarter-over-quarter"

### 3. Action-Oriented
Focus on what to do, not just what is. Lead with recommendations.

- **Avoid**: "The situation requires attention"
- **Use**: "Implement three changes by Q2"

### 4. Concise
Eliminate unnecessary words. Every word must earn its place.

- **Avoid**: "Due to the fact that we have limited resources"
- **Use**: "Given resource constraints"

## Phrase Patterns

### Avoid → Use Instead

| Avoid | Use Instead | Context |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| "We believe that..." | "Our analysis shows..." | Opening statements |
| "It seems like..." | "The data indicates..." | Data interpretation |
| "We should consider..." | "We recommend..." | Recommendations |
| "There is a possibility..." | "X is likely because..." | Risk/opportunity |
| "In order to" | "To" | Any context |
| "At this point in time" | "Now" | Temporal references |
| "It is important to note that" | [Delete entirely] | Filler phrases |
| "As you can see" | [Delete entirely] | Presentation crutches |
| "Basically" | [Delete entirely] | Verbal filler |
| "I think" / "I feel" | [State directly] | Personal hedging |

### Hedging Words to Eliminate

Remove these unless genuinely uncertain:
- Might, may, could, perhaps
- Somewhat, relatively, fairly
- Possibly, potentially, arguably
- Sort of, kind of, more or less

### Power Verbs for Recommendations

Replace weak verbs with action verbs:

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| Look at | Analyze, evaluate, assess |
| Do | Execute, implement, deliver |
| Make better | Optimize, enhance, improve |
| Think about | Consider, evaluate, prioritize |
| Work on | Develop, build, create |

## Sentence Structure

### Rules

1. **Lead with the action or finding** - Put the main point first
2. **Keep sentences under 25 words** - Shorter is stronger
3. **One idea per sentence** - Split complex thoughts
4. **Use active voice** - Subject acts on object
5. **Front-load key information** - Important details first

### Active Voice Conversion

| Passive (Avoid) | Active (Use) |
|-----------------|--------------|
| "The report was reviewed by the team" | "The team reviewed the report" |
| "Costs can be reduced by automation" | "Automation reduces costs" |
| "It was decided that..." | "We decided..." |

### Sentence Length Check

- **Ideal**: 10-20 words
- **Acceptable**: 21-25 words
- **Too long**: 26+ words → Split into two sentences

## Example Transformations

### Example 1: Executive Summary

**Before** (47 words):
> "Based on our comprehensive analysis of the available data and taking into consideration the various factors that we have identified, we believe that there might be an opportunity to potentially reduce operational costs, although we should note that further investigation may be required."

**After** (16 words):
> "Analysis reveals a $2M cost reduction opportunity in supply chain operations. Three actions drive 80% of savings."

**Improvements**:
- Eliminated hedging ("might", "potentially", "believe")
- Added specific numbers ($2M, 80%)
- Split into two focused sentences
- Cut word count by 66%

### Example 2: Recommendation

**Before** (32 words):
> "We should consider implementing a new customer relationship management system in order to better track and manage our interactions with customers, which could potentially improve customer satisfaction levels."

**After** (14 words):
> "Implement a new CRM to increase customer satisfaction scores by 15% within six months."

**Improvements**:
- "Should consider" → Direct imperative
- "In order to" → Deleted
- Added specific metric (15%) and timeline (six months)
- Cut word count by 56%

### Example 3: Risk Statement

**Before** (28 words):
> "It seems like there is a possibility that we might face some challenges with regulatory compliance if we do not take appropriate action in this area soon."

**After** (14 words):
> "Regulatory non-compliance risk is high. Address three gaps before Q3 to avoid penalties."

**Improvements**:
- "Seems like" → Direct assertion
- "Possibility" → Quantified risk level
- Added specific action (three gaps) and deadline (Q3)
- Cut word count by 50%

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any presentation text:

- [ ] No hedging words (might, could, perhaps, potentially)
- [ ] No filler phrases (basically, it is important to note)
- [ ] All sentences under 25 words
- [ ] Active voice throughout
- [ ] Specific numbers where claims are made
- [ ] Recommendations use imperative verbs
- [ ] One idea per sentence
- [ ] Action titles (not topic titles) on slides

## Context Exceptions

### When Hedging Is Appropriate

Use qualified language only when:
- Legal disclaimers require it
- Genuinely uncertain and uncertainty matters
- Diplomatic context requires softening
- Presenting others' opinions vs. facts

### Creative/Persuasive Sections

For storytelling or emotional appeal sections:
- Slightly longer sentences acceptable (up to 30 words)
- Some narrative flow may require connecting words
- Still avoid filler phrases
