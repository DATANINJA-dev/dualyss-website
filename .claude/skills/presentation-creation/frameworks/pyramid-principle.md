# Pyramid Principle

The Pyramid Principle, developed by Barbara Minto at McKinsey, is the foundation of effective business communication. It structures arguments from conclusion to supporting evidence.

## Core Concept

**Start with the answer.** Don't build up to your recommendation - lead with it.

```
        ┌─────────────────────┐
        │   MAIN MESSAGE      │  ← Start here (answer/recommendation)
        │ (Single sentence)   │
        └─────────────────────┘
                  │
    ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
    ▼             ▼             ▼
┌───────┐   ┌───────┐   ┌───────┐
│ Key   │   │ Key   │   │ Key   │  ← 3-5 supporting arguments
│Arg 1  │   │Arg 2  │   │Arg 3  │
└───────┘   └───────┘   └───────┘
    │           │           │
  ┌─┴─┐       ┌─┴─┐       ┌─┴─┐
  │ E │       │ E │       │ E │  ← Evidence for each argument
  └───┘       └───┘       └───┘
```

## The Three Rules

### 1. Ideas at any level must summarize the ideas below

The parent idea should be a synthesis, not just a grouping label.

```
BAD:  "Three things to discuss"
      - Budget
      - Timeline
      - Resources

GOOD: "Project requires $2M over 18 months with dedicated team"
      - Budget: $2M covers development and launch
      - Timeline: 18 months to market readiness
      - Resources: 12 FTE dedicated team
```

### 2. Ideas within a group must be logically ordered

Choose one ordering principle and apply consistently:

| Order Type | When to Use | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Chronological** | Processes, timelines | Q1 → Q2 → Q3 → Q4 |
| **Structural** | Organization, geography | HQ → Region → Local |
| **Importance** | Priorities, impact | Critical → Important → Nice-to-have |
| **Deductive** | Logical arguments | If A, and B, then C |

### 3. Ideas within a group must be MECE

**Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive**

- **Mutually Exclusive**: No overlaps between categories
- **Collectively Exhaustive**: Nothing important is missing

```
BAD (overlapping):
- Customer acquisition
- Marketing campaigns    ← overlaps with acquisition
- Sales pipeline

GOOD (MECE):
- New customer acquisition
- Existing customer retention
- Customer expansion (upsell/cross-sell)
```

## Application to Slides

### Opening Slide

Lead with the recommendation:

```
Title: "Expand into APAC market by Q3 to capture 15% share"
       (not "APAC Market Analysis")
```

### Supporting Slides

Each slide proves one supporting argument:

```
Slide 1: [Main recommendation - lead with answer]
Slide 2: [Argument 1 + evidence]
Slide 3: [Argument 2 + evidence]
Slide 4: [Argument 3 + evidence]
Slide 5: [Implementation plan]
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Bottom-up structure | Audience loses interest before conclusion | Invert - lead with answer |
| Too many arguments | Cognitive overload | Limit to 3-5 key points |
| Arguments at different levels | Confusing hierarchy | Ensure same abstraction level |
| Non-MECE groupings | Gaps or overlaps in logic | Test exclusivity and exhaustiveness |

## Quick Reference

When structuring any presentation:

1. **What is your one main message?** (Write this first)
2. **What are 3-5 reasons this is true?** (Supporting arguments)
3. **What evidence supports each reason?** (Data, examples, analysis)
4. **Is your grouping MECE?** (No overlaps, nothing missing)
5. **Are ideas logically ordered?** (Pick one ordering principle)
