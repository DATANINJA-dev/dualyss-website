# SCR Structure (Situation-Complication-Resolution)

The SCR framework creates a compelling narrative arc that hooks the audience and leads them to your recommendation.

> **Back to**: [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md)

## The Three Elements

### Situation (S)
**Where we are now** - Establish common ground with facts everyone agrees on.

- Current state of affairs
- Shared understanding
- Context the audience already knows
- Recent developments

### Complication (C)
**What changed or what's wrong** - Create tension that demands resolution.

- The problem or challenge
- Why the situation is unstable
- What's at stake if we don't act
- The urgency factor

### Resolution (R)
**What we should do** - Your recommendation that resolves the tension.

- Proposed action or solution
- Expected outcomes
- Clear next steps
- Call to action

## Examples

### Business Case Example

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Situation** | Our customer support team handles 10,000 tickets/month with 24h average response time. Customer satisfaction is at 78%. |
| **Complication** | Ticket volume has grown 40% YoY while team size stayed flat. Response time now exceeds 48h and CSAT dropped to 65%. Top competitors offer <4h response. |
| **Resolution** | Implement AI-powered triage system to automate 60% of tickets, reducing response time to <8h and freeing agents for complex issues. Investment: $200K. ROI: 18 months. |

### Product Launch Example

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Situation** | We're the #2 player in enterprise CRM with 25% market share. Our platform excels at sales automation. |
| **Complication** | Market is shifting to unified platforms. Competitors now offer marketing + sales + service. We're losing deals to "all-in-one" solutions. |
| **Resolution** | Launch integrated marketing module by Q3. Partner with ServiceNow for service desk. Position as "best-of-breed unified platform." |

## Extended Variations

### SCQA (add Question)

For situations where you need to frame the problem explicitly:

```
Situation  → What's the context?
Complication → What's the problem?
Question   → What should we do?     ← Explicit question
Answer     → Here's our recommendation
```

### SCRS (add Stakes)

When you need to emphasize consequences:

```
Situation    → Where we are
Complication → What's wrong
Stakes       → What happens if we don't act  ← Urgency amplifier
Resolution   → What we should do
```

## Writing Tips

### Situation
- Keep it brief (2-3 bullets max)
- Use facts, not opinions
- Establish credibility through accuracy
- Don't include anything controversial

### Complication
- Make it specific and quantified
- Connect to business impact (revenue, costs, risk)
- Create appropriate urgency without fear-mongering
- Show why status quo is unacceptable

### Resolution
- Be clear and actionable
- Include the "so what" (benefits)
- Anticipate objections
- Provide clear next steps

## Slide Application

### Single SCR Slide (Executive Summary)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Action Title: Your Main Recommendation]                    │
├───────────────────┬─────────────────┬───────────────────────┤

│                   │                 │                       │
│ • Bullet 1        │ • Problem 1     │ • Action 1            │

│ • Bullet 3        │ • Impact        │ • Expected result     │
├───────────────────┴─────────────────┴───────────────────────┤

```

### Multi-Slide SCR Flow

```
Slide 1: Executive Summary (full SCR)
Slide 2-3: Situation deep dive (context, data)
Slide 4-5: Complication analysis (problem, impact)
Slide 6-8: Resolution details (approach, implementation)
Slide 9: Summary & Next Steps
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Situation too long | Loses audience before problem | Max 3 bullets |
| Complication too mild | No urgency to act | Quantify the pain |
| Resolution too vague | No clear action | Specific recommendations |
| Skipping to Resolution | Audience not convinced | Build the case first |
