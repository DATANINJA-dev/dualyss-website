# Action Titles

Action titles state the slide's main point as a complete thought, not just a topic label. They're the single most important element of consulting-style presentations.

> **Back to**: [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md)

## The Principle

**Every slide title should be a complete sentence that states the takeaway.**

If someone only reads your titles, they should understand your entire argument.

## Topic vs. Action Titles

| Topic Title (BAD) | Action Title (GOOD) |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Q3 Sales Results | Q3 Sales Exceeded Target by 15% |
| Cost Analysis | Three Cost Drivers Account for 80% of Overruns |
| Market Overview | APAC Market Will Double by 2028 |
| Customer Survey | 78% of Customers Would Recommend Us |
| Implementation Plan | Full Rollout Achievable in 6 Months |
| Risk Assessment | Integration Risk is Highest Priority |
| Budget Request | $2M Investment Yields 3x ROI in Year One |

## Writing Effective Action Titles

### 1. Make it a complete thought

```
BAD:  "Competitive Landscape"
GOOD: "We're Third in Market Share but First in Growth Rate"
```

### 2. Include the "so what"

```
BAD:  "Customer Churn Increased 5%"
GOOD: "5% Churn Increase Costs $3M Annually"
```

### 3. Be specific with numbers

```
BAD:  "Sales Improved Significantly"
GOOD: "Sales Grew 23% YoY, Outpacing Market by 2x"
```

### 4. Take a clear position

```
BAD:  "Option A vs Option B Analysis"
GOOD: "Option A Delivers Higher ROI with Lower Risk"
```

### 5. Make it actionable when appropriate

```
BAD:  "Technology Stack Assessment"
GOOD: "Migrate to Cloud-Native Architecture by Q4"
```

## Title Formulas

### For data slides
```
[Number] + [What it means] + [Why it matters]

"78% of customers are satisfied, but NPS trails competitors by 15 points"
```

### For recommendation slides
```
[Action verb] + [Specific action] + [Expected outcome]

"Launch mobile app by June to capture 25% of millennial segment"
```

### For analysis slides
```
[Key finding] + [Implication or comparison]

"Production costs are 20% below industry average due to automation"
```

### For timeline slides
```
[Milestone] + [Timeline] + [Confidence/dependency]

"MVP launch in Q2 depends on completing API integration by March"
```

## The Title Test

**Storyline test**: Read only your slide titles in sequence. Do they tell a coherent story?

```
1. "We need to expand into APAC to maintain growth"
2. "APAC market will double by 2028"
3. "Three countries offer best entry opportunities"
4. "Partnership model reduces entry risk by 60%"
5. "Recommended: Enter through Singapore in Q3"
```

✓ This sequence tells a complete story through titles alone.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Vague labels | "Overview" | State the key insight |
| Questions as titles | "Should we expand?" | Answer the question |
| Too long | 3+ lines of text | Max 2 lines |
| No verb | "Customer satisfaction" | Add what happened |
| Hedging | "Sales may have increased" | Be definitive |
| Jargon | "Synergistic value creation" | Plain language |

## Quick Reference

When writing your title, ask:

1. **What's the one thing I want the audience to remember from this slide?**
2. **Could someone skip the slide body and still get the point?**
3. **Is this a complete sentence with a verb?**
4. **Am I being specific (numbers, timeframes, comparisons)?**
5. **Am I taking a clear position (not hedging)?**
