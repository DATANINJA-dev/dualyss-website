# Product-Scale Question Framework

Use these questions for product-scale ideas (new SaaS, platforms, major product initiatives).

## Phase 1: Vision & Problem

### Core Vision Questions

1. **Problem statement**: "What problem does this solve, and for whom?"
2. **Why now**: "Why is now the right time to build this?"
3. **Unique angle**: "What makes your approach different from existing solutions?"
4. **Success vision**: "If this succeeds wildly, what does that look like in 1 year?"

### Validation Questions

1. "Have you validated this problem with potential users?"
2. "What's the smallest thing you could build to test the core assumption?"
3. "What would make you abandon this idea?"

## Phase 2: Market & Competition

### Competitive Landscape

1. "Who are the main competitors or alternatives?"
2. "What do existing solutions do well? What's frustrating about them?"
3. "Which competitor's users would you most want to convert? Why?"

### Market Position

1. "What's your positioning? (Cheaper, faster, specialized, integrated, etc.)"
2. "What's the one thing you want to be known for?"
3. "Who would NOT be a good fit for this product?"

## Phase 3: Users & Personas

### Primary Persona

1. "Describe your ideal first customer in detail"
2. "What's their current workflow for solving this problem?"
3. "What's their biggest frustration with the status quo?"
4. "How would they discover and evaluate your solution?"

### Secondary Personas

1. "Who else will use this besides the primary user?"
2. "Are there different user types with different needs? (Admin vs user, buyer vs end-user)"
3. "Are there anti-personas - users you explicitly don't want to target?"

## Phase 4: Scope & MVP

### MVP Definition

1. "What's the ONE thing this product must do extremely well?"
2. "If you could only ship 3 features, which would they be?"
3. "What features are you tempted to include but shouldn't for v1?"

### Boundaries

1. "What's explicitly out of scope for v1?"
2. "What integrations or platforms are must-have vs nice-to-have?"
3. "Are there any hard technical constraints?"

## Phase 5: Success & Metrics

### Success Metrics

1. "How will you measure if this is working?"
2. "What's your target metric for month 1? Month 6?"
3. "What user behavior indicates product-market fit?"

### Business Model

1. "How will this make money?" (Subscription, usage, enterprise, etc.)
2. "What's the price point you're targeting?"
3. "Who's the buyer? (Same as user, or different?)"

## Question Prioritization

For product-scale discovery, prioritize in this order:

1. **Must Ask** (block if unclear):
   - Problem statement
   - Primary persona
   - Core value proposition
   - MVP features

2. **Should Ask** (warn if unclear):
   - Competitive landscape
   - Success metrics
   - Business model

3. **Nice to Ask** (proceed if unclear):
   - Secondary personas
   - Post-MVP roadmap
   - Detailed pricing

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Don't ask about implementation details (that's for tasks)
- Don't assume business model if not mentioned
- Don't project competitor features onto user needs
- Don't skip validation questions for "obvious" ideas
